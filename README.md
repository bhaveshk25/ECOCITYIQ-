#  EcoCityIQ: Air Quality Patterns and Pollution Forecasting

**EcoCityIQ** is a data science project that explores global air quality trends, analyzes pollutant behaviors, and forecasts pollution levels using real-world EPA datasets. It aims to uncover hidden patterns in air quality data and provide actionable insights for sustainable urban development.

---

##  Objectives

- Analyze global and seasonal air quality trends.
- Perform pollutant-wise comparative analysis.
- Identify pollution hotspots using geospatial analysis.
- Conduct hypothesis testing to validate data assumptions.
- Forecast air pollution using machine learning models.
